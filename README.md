# Wk-1-HW
This is my first read me on my first hw in  coding class.
The challenge was easy, so I have no excuses for all the mistakes I made. 
My search history is full of fun things like " how do I make the nav bar show up on th same line as the header?" and "how do i make a image show up to the left of the text in a section?"
I imagine normally a read me has more information about the website and updates I made to the coding but that is for another read me
This is my read me. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My read me is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life
